However, for a harmonious society, crime is an eternal stumbling block. Therefore, controlling crime is particularly important. Modern crimes can be roughly divided into two categories, violent crimes and property crimes. The former includes murder, rape and other vicious acts, while the latter is often related to money. Both types of crimes have a bad influence on the stability of society. For example, according to a recent report in the New York Times，an estimated 45,000 Americans are behind bars for thefts of less than $10,000 while the punishment doesn’t fit the crime. Not to mention violent crimes, once they happen, they are likely to bring devastating blows to individuals or families that can affect a lifetime. 2020 was an unfortunate year for the whole world. In a relatively turbulent social environment, we should pay more attention to crime and make our contribution to reducing and preventing crime.This is why we are interested in crime topics. After learning this course, we have the ability to explore the laws and characteristics of data through visualization. Considering that the national data volume is too large, in order to draw more detailed conclusions, we decided to focus on the state of New York where Columbia University is located. We found the criminal record statistics of various counties and police agencies in New York State since 1990, including violent crimes(murder, rape, robbery, etc) and property crimes(burglary, vehicle theft, etc). We hope to explore the law of crime in New York State through visual analysis of this data set, and provide our insights and suggestions. In order to achieve our goal, we set up the following three questions： 1）In recent years, what is the distribution of the total number of crimes of different categories and subcategories? Which crime is the most common in number? 2）In recent years, how has the total number of crimes been geographically distributed? Are there any counties with high crime rates that are far ahead? 3）Extending the time frame to 30 years, how has the number of crimes in New York State changed during these 30 years? Is there a consistent trend? It is worth noting that because the data set has a large range of missing values in ‘month’, and we have realized some of the limitations of the data set in the process of working, our above three questions are changed compared with those submitted during datacheck. Nevertheless, we still believe that the answers to the above three questions can help us better understand the crime situation in New York State. In the following content, we will introduce the source of the dataset, the data pre-processing process, the plots drawn to answer the above three questions, and the analysis of our results. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our dataset was exported from the following link: Index Crimes by County and Agency: Beginning 1990 The data was posted on data.ny.gov. As mentioned on the website, The Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) collects crime reports from more than 500 New York State police and sheriffs’ departments. DCJS compiles these reports as New York’s official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. The dataset has 15 columns and about 20.6k rows. Then columns includes county, agency, year(from 1990 to 2019), counts of total crimes, violent crimes and property crimes and their corresponding sub-types. There is also a column indicating whether the county belongs to New York City. Except for the three text columns(County, Agency and Region), all datatypes are numbers. For every county, there is one column where agency is ‘County Total’, and this means the sum of all agencies in this county. Since we take county data as the smallest research unit of this project, we only focus on these ‘County Total’ records. Although the dataset includes all the 62 counties in the state, there still exists problems: Not all agencies have complete reporting as indicated by the number of months reported (“Months reported” column). Due to a system conversion in 2002, number of months reported (“Months reported”) is not available for any years prior to 2002. To solve this, we choose to ignore the month data and focus on year level. Some agencies became obsolete or were newly formed during the reporting period covered. Agencies may also experience reporting problems that can account for unusual changes in counts over time. Agencies may not have entries for each year due to incomplete reporting, no incidences of index crimes for a particular year or they were not an active agency in that year. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. In a word, the counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred. Since it’s really hard to get all the crime data that are not recorded or reported, we have to assume that the present data can represent the crime situation in New York. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Fortunately, the downloaded data was available in csv format. As a result, loading in the data for analysis into R was largely straightforward. So we only apply certain transformations to the data for convenience for detailed analysis. First of all, since the smallest unit we focused on is county, we do not need the data from specific agencies. As the data has already contained “County Total” rows, we extracted these rows for future analysis. Secondly, as we mentioned in Chapter 2, many month values are not available. Since we only focus on the year level, we remove the month column from the dataset. Finally, we transform the data according to the specific question we want to explore. For example, when we want to connect the data to map data in order to draw a geographical heat map, we transfer the county names to lower case, for convenience of join to map_data. Also, for missing values essential for our analysis, we tried to add average values from the same county to ensure the completeness. These changes will be discusses in detail later.

Once you mouse over the region, it will show its statistics of hate crimes on the side, helping you understand hate crime situation in different counties in a more straight way. With an interative map, audiences are able to know which region is which county, which is hard to achieve in the static heatmap as we conducted in the previous questions. In the static heatmap, if we label all the counties, the heatmap will become messy and difficult to view due to its relatively small size. An interactive map has the advantanges to show geological locations and their corresponding information and statistical data at the same time. Therefore, audiences can have better understanding of various types of hate crimes in different regions. The map data are provided on Wikimedia Commons. They were created using US Census Data in 2005 and Adobe Illustrator. You will probably notice that no data are showing up for NYC, Bronx and Long Island. That’s because some counties are created as “polygon” and some are “path”. Therefore, it’s hard to color them using D3 functions at the same time. We are still in the progress of learning D3, and we will make it in better view in the future. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
