However, for a harmonious society, crime is an eternal stumbling block. Therefore, controlling crime is particularly important. Modern crimes can be roughly divided into two categories, violent crimes and property crimes. The former includes murder, rape and other vicious acts, while the latter is often related to money. Both types of crimes have a bad influence on the stability of society. For example, according to a recent report in the New York Times，an estimated 45,000 Americans are behind bars for thefts of less than $10,000 while the punishment doesn’t fit the crime. Not to mention violent crimes, once they happen, they are likely to bring devastating blows to individuals or families that can affect a lifetime. 2020 was an unfortunate year for the whole world. In a relatively turbulent social environment, we should pay more attention to crime and make our contribution to reducing and preventing crime.This is why we are interested in crime topics. After learning this course, we have the ability to explore the laws and characteristics of data through visualization. Considering that the national data volume is too large, in order to draw more detailed conclusions, we decided to focus on the state of New York where Columbia University is located. We found the criminal record statistics of various counties and police agencies in New York State since 1990, including violent crimes(murder, rape, robbery, etc) and property crimes(burglary, vehicle theft, etc). We hope to explore the law of crime in New York State through visual analysis of this data set, and provide our insights and suggestions. In order to achieve our goal, we set up the following three questions： 1）In recent years, what is the distribution of the total number of crimes of different categories and subcategories? Which crime is the most common in number? 2）In recent years, how has the total number of crimes been geographically distributed? Are there any counties with high crime rates that are far ahead? 3）Extending the time frame to 30 years, how has the number of crimes in New York State changed during these 30 years? Is there a consistent trend? It is worth noting that because the data set has a large range of missing values in ‘month’, and we have realized some of the limitations of the data set in the process of working, our above three questions are changed compared with those submitted during datacheck. Nevertheless, we still believe that the answers to the above three questions can help us better understand the crime situation in New York State. In the following content, we will introduce the source of the dataset, the data pre-processing process, the plots drawn to answer the above three questions, and the analysis of our results. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our dataset was exported from the following link: Index Crimes by County and Agency: Beginning 1990 The data was posted on data.ny.gov. As mentioned on the website, The Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) collects crime reports from more than 500 New York State police and sheriffs’ departments. DCJS compiles these reports as New York’s official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. The dataset has 15 columns and about 20.6k rows. Then columns includes county, agency, year(from 1990 to 2019), counts of total crimes, violent crimes and property crimes and their corresponding sub-types. There is also a column indicating whether the county belongs to New York City. Except for the three text columns(County, Agency and Region), all datatypes are numbers. For every county, there is one column where agency is ‘County Total’, and this means the sum of all agencies in this county. Since we take county data as the smallest research unit of this project, we only focus on these ‘County Total’ records. Although the dataset includes all the 62 counties in the state, there still exists problems: Not all agencies have complete reporting as indicated by the number of months reported (“Months reported” column). Due to a system conversion in 2002, number of months reported (“Months reported”) is not available for any years prior to 2002. To solve this, we choose to ignore the month data and focus on year level. Some agencies became obsolete or were newly formed during the reporting period covered. Agencies may also experience reporting problems that can account for unusual changes in counts over time. Agencies may not have entries for each year due to incomplete reporting, no incidences of index crimes for a particular year or they were not an active agency in that year. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. In a word, the counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred. Since it’s really hard to get all the crime data that are not recorded or reported, we have to assume that the present data can represent the crime situation in New York. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Fortunately, the downloaded data was available in csv format. As a result, loading in the data for analysis into R was largely straightforward. So we only apply certain transformations to the data for convenience for detailed analysis. First of all, since the smallest unit we focused on is county, we do not need the data from specific agencies. As the data has already contained “County Total” rows, we extracted these rows for future analysis. Secondly, as we mentioned in Chapter 2, many month values are not available. Since we only focus on the year level, we remove the month column from the dataset. Finally, we transform the data according to the specific question we want to explore. For example, when we want to connect the data to map data in order to draw a geographical heat map, we transfer the county names to lower case, for convenience of join to map_data. Also, for missing values essential for our analysis, we tried to add average values from the same county to ensure the completeness. These changes will be discusses in detail later. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Our data is downloaded directly from New York State Government website. Since collected by the Division of Criminal Justice Services(DCJS) from more than 500 New York State police and sheriffs’ departments from 1990 to 2019, the data suffers from various missing situations. For example, the precise month of some reports may be unclear due to long time range, and data from some police station may be fully missing in some years. We try to analyze patterns of the missing values, and to fill gaps to get tidy data for downstream tasks. First we can see the missing values in \"Index_Crimes_by_County_and_Agency__Beginning_1990.csv\" in Variable “Month.Reported” and other crime types: dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Index_Crimes_by_County_and_Agency__Beginning_1990.csv&quot;) any(is.na(dataset)) ## [1] TRUE colSums(is.na(dataset)) %&gt;% sort(decreasing = TRUE) ## Months.Reported Index.Total Violent.Total Murder ## 9436 384 384 384 ## Rape Robbery Aggravated.Assault Property.Total ## 384 384 384 384 ## Burglary Larceny Motor.Vehicle.Theft County ## 384 384 384 0 ## Agency Year Region ## 0 0 0 Now we use Visna function to analyze patterns of the missing values: In the Visna plot, missing values are categorized into two patterns. In majority cases, the months of reports are missing, while all crime reports would miss in minority cases, where we can only get information about the reported police station and year. Next we explored the correlation between variables and missing types. The “months of reports” missing distributes quite uniformly with respect to all variables including year, county, agency and region. Since variable Months.Reports is not used in our data analysis part, we are more interested in the other missing type where all records are missing. After analyzing relations between the “all records” missing and other variables, we find that this kind of missing only occurs in 2002 to 2007, which means it’s highly correlated with virable year. Finally, we use mean value of the county where “all records” missing happens in the same year to fill the second kind of missing values. Because the missing ratio of all records\" is relatively small(about 1.5%) and the standard deviation of the same county in one year is also small, our filling process is making sense. Further, it’s very helpful for us to acquire tidy data for downstream data analysis. For the “months of reports” missing, we leave it in our tidy dataset since we don’t need this variable, and any filling to this missing is meaningless. We saved our tidy data in “Tidydata_Crime.csv”. Next checking the missing values in the filled dataset. tidy_dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Tidydata_Crime.csv&quot;) any(is.na(tidy_dataset$Index.Total)) ## [1] FALSE Now we can analize our preprocessed dataset “Tidydata_Crime.csv” with out missing values that may cause data gaps. "],["chapter-5.html", "Chapter 5 Chapter 5 5.1 General Picture of Crimes In New York State", " Chapter 5 Chapter 5 5.1 General Picture of Crimes In New York State How many crimes have taken placed in New York? What types of crimes happended most times in recent years? And are there differences of crimes happened in cities and non-cities? Here are the general results of these questions. Crimes are classified into two broad categories: violent crimes and property crimes. Then violent crimes include Murder, Rape, Robbery and Aggravated Assault, while property crimes include Burglary, Larceny and Motor Vehicle Theft. We also divided crime by the reigion: city or non-city. And the data are the sum of the data in 2017-2019. From plot 5.1.1(a), we can discover that most crimes are property crimes, which takes up over 80% of the total crimes. Nearly half of the property crimes happened in cities, while almost 3/4 of the violent crimes happened in cities. Then we look into the specific types of crimes in New York. For violent crimes, the amounts of Murder, Rape, Robbery and Aggravated Assault increase in sequence and most happened in the cities. So for the people live in the cities, they should take care of being violated by these crimes. For property crimes, Larceny happened the most, which takes up 80% of the property crimes. And there are little differences between cities and non-cities. To show a general distribution of the crimes, we plot the density of counties by the number of crimes in plot 5.1.2. The x-axis is interval of number of crimes, while y-axis show the normalized ratio of counties in this interval. We can discover most counties has a low crime rate, while the counties of which total crimes in 3 yrs &gt; 20,000 are the minority. To show a general trend of crimes amount, we plot this heatmap of crimes in 5.1.3. In this general part, we used the origin data from the dataset. And we can see that the counties with high crimes amount showed in 5.1.2 has the trend that total crimes decreased every year.

Once you mouse over the region, it will show its statistics of different crimes. On the right side of the map, it will show the amount of the total crimes between 2017-2019. On the first row, it shows the amount of different types of violent crimes, and on the second row, it shows the amount of diffrent types of crimes of property crimes.So from the location of every counties on the map, you can easily access the data of that county, helping you understand different types of crimes in different counties in a more straight way. An interactive map has the advantange to show geological locations and their corresponding information and statistical data at the same time. Therefore, audiences can have better understanding of various types of crimes in different regions. Reference: The map data are provided on Wikimedia Commons.
