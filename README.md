This is the final project of STAT GR 5702 for Spring 2021 at Columbia University. Our team members are Ying Bi, Hang Luo and Gaoge Liu. We are all master students at Columbia DSI.

In this project, we used the data set from Data.ny.gov and did exploratory data analysis and visuliazation on crime counts across counties in NY state.  Our results was intergrated as a bookdown: https://gnib23.github.io/NY_Crime_EDAV/

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate.*
